# Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Project-1-Investigate-a-dataset
### First project in Udacity's ALX Data Analyst Nanodgree Program

Purpose of this project is to investigate the TMDb dataset (The Movie Database), which is a database that contains information about around 10,000 movies, like popularity, user ratings, cast, revenue, etc. 

This project is divided into 3 phases: 
- Dataset investigation
- Data cleaning
- Data analysis and visualization 

By the end, I summarize my analysis by answering 4 questions: 
1. Does runtime affect vote?
2. Do production companies affect vote?
3. Do production companies affect revenue?
4. Does budget affectt revenue?

### Packages used: 
##### Numpy
##### Pandas 
##### Matplotlib
